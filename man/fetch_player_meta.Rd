\title{Fetch Player Meta Data}
\usage{
fetch_player_meta(playerid)
}
\arguments{
\item{playerid}{A vector of player IDs as given in Cricinfo profiles. Integer or character.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing meta data on the selected players, with one row for
each player.
}
\description{
Fetch player meta data from ESPNCricinfo and return a tibble with one line
per player. To identify the players, use their Cricinfo player IDs.
The simplest way to find this is to look up their Cricinfo Profile page. The number
at the end of the URL is the ID. For example, Meg Lanning's profile page is
https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/meg-lanning-329336,
so her ID is 329336.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Download meta data on Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry
aus_women <- fetch_player_meta(c(329336, 275487))
}
}
\seealso{
It is usually simpler to just use the saved data set \link{player_meta}
which contains the meta data for all players on ESPNCricinfo as at 24 March 2025.
To find a player ID, use \code{\link[=find_player_id]{find_player_id()}}.
Use \code{\link[=fetch_player_data]{fetch_player_data()}} to download playing statistics for a player.
